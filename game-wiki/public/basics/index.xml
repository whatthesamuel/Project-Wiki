      <description>You need Steam and Epic games store installed and logged in before starting. This will not be required after official release. You need Steam installed and opened.
In order to get the game more polished, currently the updates are being delayed.
You can download the zip files on https://dl.whatthesamuel.com(Important! The email security code is a Cloudflare feature. I don&amp;rsquo;t collect any data).
I recommend you download the latest version by looking at the dates next to the file names</description>
