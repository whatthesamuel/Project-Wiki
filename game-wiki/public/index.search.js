Both must be opened and logged in to play multiplayer.\nCheck if Steam and Epic Games Launcher is both logged in and running Run the game and check if you can access the steam or epic friends menu, if not, you’ll see an error message. Please report the bug if you can. If all went well, you can either Host or Join a game from the main menu. Method 2: The Other Way Install and set up Hamachi(or similar custom vpns, but Hamachi is easy to use)\nSet up a server in Hamachi and connect to the host(up to 5 people)\ncopy the IPv4 address Open the command prompt(press windows key and search for ‘command’) and enter the following command: \u003cgame location\u003e \u003cipv4 address\u003e -log (replace the game location and ipv4 address with your appropriate environment)\nexample: Depending on your computer’s specs, you might have to wait a bit for the game to load, so don’t panic unless it takes illogically long to open. You’ll join the host soon. ",
