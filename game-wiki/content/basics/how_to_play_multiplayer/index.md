Â Currently, I'm having some issues with EOS working with steam, so meanwhile, here is a temporary workaround.    
    
1. Install and set up [Hamachi](https://www.vpn.net/)(or similar custom vpns, but Hamachi is easy to use)

2. Set up a server in Hamachi and connect to the host(up to 5 people)    

3. copy the IPv4 address

4. Open the command prompt(press windows key and search for 'command') and enter the following command: ``` <game location> <ipv4 address> -log ```    
(replace the game location and ipv4 address with your appropriate environment)    
    
example:

5. Depending on your computer's specs, you might have to wait a bit for the game to load, so don't panic unless it takes illogically long to open. You'll join the host soon.
